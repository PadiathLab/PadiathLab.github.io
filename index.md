# Padiath Lab's Website

The major focus of the Padiath lab is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying various neurological disorders. To achieve this, the lab uses human genetic approaches as well as research on model organisms such as mice and flies. Presently, we are studying the genetic basis of the a class of demyelinating disorders know as leukodystrophies.

A major focus of lab is the adult onset demyelinating disorder, Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD) that is caused by the overexpression of the nuclear lamina protein, Lamin B1.

We hope that understanding demyelinating disease mechanisms will help us identify novel pathways that regulate myelin formation and maintenance.
